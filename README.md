# Real-time-voice-translation-and-sign-language-detection
This project integrates real-time voice translation and sign language detection for accessible communication. It supports online/offline speech translation, gesture recognition using Mediapipe + LSTM, and a Streamlit interface for recording, translating, and detecting signs through webcam input.
